Create a rotating planet as shown below in OpenGL. (In real execution it is rotating.)

![* In real execution it will  be rotating][image1]

* It draws sphere with radius=5, slices=20, and stacks=20, centered around the origin.

* It sets the perspective projection, camera, and transform the planet so that the planet is located at the center of the screen facing to your eyes.

* `scuff.ppm` is the source of the texture image.

The planet will be rotating, the ambient light is blue, the background is black, and specular light is set to highlight the center area.
